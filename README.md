# A basic SpringBoot + Angular RESTful E-Commerce web app hopsted on Heroku 

All of the page sections are Angular components that are populated with data (Product, Product Category, State, Country) from a MySQL database through Spring Data REST JPA calls.

This project is based on a course by Chad Darby at https://www.udemy.com/course/full-stack-angular-spring-boot-tutorial/

For the backend I did the heroku deployment including MySQL database set up.

The course and deployment were a lot of fun. I look forward to creating more Angular/React + SpringBoot applications.
